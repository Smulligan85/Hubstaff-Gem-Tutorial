# Hubstaff Gem Tutorial

This repository contains the starting Rails application for the Hubstaff Gem Tutorial (TODO: Add link to tutorial). Fork and clone the master branch to follow along with the tutorial. A copy of the fully implemented application is also available under the final branch. The tutorial covers how to install the hubstaff gem, authenticate a new client, goes over retrieving data from two common endpoints via the gems built in methods.
