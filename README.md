# Hubstaff Gem Tutorial Application

This repository contains the starting Rails application for the [Hubstaff Gem Tutorial](https://github.com/hookengine/hubstaff-api-tutorials/blob/master/hubstaff-ruby-tutorial.md). Fork and clone the master branch to follow along with the tutorial. A copy of the fully implemented application is also available under the final-tut branch. The tutorial covers how to install the `hubstaff-ruby` gem, authenticate a new client, and goes over retrieving data from two common endpoints via the gem's built in methods.
