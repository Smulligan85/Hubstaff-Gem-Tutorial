# Hubstaff Gem Tutorial Application

This repository contains the starting Rails application for the Hubstaff Gem Tutorial. Fork and clone the master branch to follow along with the tutorial. A copy of the fully implemented application is also available under the final-tut branch. The tutorial covers how to install the `hubstaff-ruby` gem, authenticate a new client, and goes over retrieving data from two common endpoints via the gem's built in methods.
